# üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Missing Environment Variables

## Current Issue
Your Telegram bot is deployed but **commands are failing** because these environment variables are missing from Railway:

### ‚ùå Missing Variables

1. **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN** - Your bot won't respond without this
2. **LOTTO_PROGRAM_ID** - Bot can't interact with Solana program
3. **AUTHORITY_SECRET_KEY** - Bot can't sign transactions
4. **ADMIN_API_TOKEN** - Admin endpoints won't work
5. **SOLANA_RPC_URL** - Connection to Solana network
6. **SOLANA_CLUSTER** - Which network to use

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix - Add These Now

### Step 1: Go to Railway

---

#### Variable 1: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You need to paste your actual bot token here from @BotFather

---

```
Name:  AUTHORITY_SECRET_KEY

---

## ‚úÖ After Deployment - Verify

### Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://wealth-wars-bot-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "services": {
      "database": "healthy",
      "lotto": "healthy",
      "telegram": "healthy"  ‚Üê Should say "healthy" not "not configured"
    }
  }
}
```

### Check Bot Logs
```bash
cd /workspaces/wealth-wars-landing/packages/backend
railway logs | grep -i telegram
```

Should see:
```
[Telegram] ‚úÖ Bot initialized and launched
```

### Test Bot Commands
In Telegram, try:
- `/start` - Should get welcome message
- `/round` - Should show current round info
- `/balance` - Should show your wallet balance

---

## üéØ What This Fixes

‚úÖ Bot will respond to commands  
‚úÖ `/round` will show active lotto round  
‚úÖ `/join` will work for joining rounds  
‚úÖ `/balance` will show Solana wallet info  
‚úÖ Admin UI on website will work with ADMIN_API_TOKEN  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Your Bot Token

I don't have access to your actual `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. You need to:

1. Find it in your Telegram chat with @BotFather
2. Or generate a new one: `/newbot` in @BotFather
3. Paste it as Variable 1 above

Without this, the bot won't start at all.

---

## üìù Summary

**Why commands fail:** Missing environment variables  
**How to fix:** Add 6 variables to Railway (listed above)  
**Time to fix:** ~5 minutes  
**When it works:** Immediately after Railway redeploys  

---

**Next Step:** Add these variables to Railway, then test your bot commands!
